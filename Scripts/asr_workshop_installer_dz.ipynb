Last update: 20230420\n","\n","The program takes two main inputs:\n","\n","* `folderToCreate`: This folder will be created in your Google Drive. It will contain the files and folders necessary for ASR training. The default is `202303-asr-workshop-ka` for the first Kaike test.<br>\n","* `sandboxes`: An array with the names of the sandboxes that will be used. It requires at least two: `sandbox-user` as a temporary bucket, and `all-wavs` as a permanent one. You can add more sandboxes if you have more than one person working on your transcriptions.<br>\n","\n","The program will perform the following tasks:\n","\n","1. Asks for permission to read and write into your Google Drive\n","2. Create folders and subfolders for each sandbox\n","3. Download exercise files\n","4. Creates the necessary Google sheets to store transcriptions\n","5.
